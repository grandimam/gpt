      I read a lot. Articles, papers, books but I kept forgetting. 
      Conversations with AI helped, but they felt scattered. 
      Nothing connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I'm building Qalam.
    </p>
    <p>
      A place where reading and thinking live together. 
      Where what I learn becomes searchable, not lost. 
      Where I can build actual expertise over time and not just have conversations that vanish.
